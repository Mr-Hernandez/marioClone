"# marioClone" 
This is more of an introduction to game programming for me, as well as in intro to more advanced c++ than I'm used to.
Some kind of platformer is what I'm making because when I looked into mario bros I didn't want to just copy their techniques.
Rather I'll fumble around in this to learn how to fumbel about and what I would like to have and such.
